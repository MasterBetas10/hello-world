# hello-world
1st repository in github after a very long period of time away from coding

Betas here, I'm on a personal challenge to update all my previous knowledge about Software Engineering some examples are Cloud (Kubernetes, Serverless), DevOps (CI/CD,Metrics,...), Microservices, API (Rest vs ReverseAPI (Webhooks), Legacy migration patterns,... PaaS (Anthos vs CloudFoundry)

More to come future betas =)
